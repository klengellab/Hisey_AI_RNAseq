# A critical role for the anterior insula in impaired adult social interaction after early life trauma

Scripts for RNA-sequencing data analysis of the anterior insula

The RNAseq_analysis.R script contains the RNA-sequencing analysis from filtering to differential expression testing with DESeq2 and correlation analysis.
The WGCNA_analyses.R script contains the WGCNA analysis carried out on the normalized data from DESeq2. 

To carry out both scripts you need to load in the scripts in the folder Functions. There are functions stored that are necessary to carry out the analyses.
